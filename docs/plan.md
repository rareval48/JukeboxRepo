# Jukebox Project Plan

### Description

The goal of this project is to create a functioning jukebox which will be able to play songs selected by the user.

The user will be able to use four buttons to navigate through menus: Next item, Previous item, Previous menu, and Select item. The menus will be displayed on an LCD screen mounted on the front of the box. To select a song, the user will use the buttons to select a genre, and then a song.

The basic design of the jukebox will be a box, with the panels connected with tabs and screws. On each side of the box, there will be a hole for a speaker. On the front of the box, the four buttons and the LCD screen will be mounted in roughly the center. Below is a very rudimentary sketch of the design:
